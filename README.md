### ML for 3D IC Reliability (2020)
**Description:** Through Silicon Via (TSV) extrusion is a crucial reliability concern which can deform and crack interconnect layers in 3D ICs and cause device failures. We develop a TSV extrusion morphology dataset, where images are categorized into three morphology classes and then train a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our model acheives near-expert accuracy for TSV morphology classification.

**Keywords:**
Machine Learning, 3D IC, Convolutional Neural Networks

### Project Graveyard
**Description:** Here lies the projects I worked on for weeks (or sometimes months) but didn't completely finish. Although these projects aren't finished there's a lot of good stuff in here:
- [Planet Exploration Game](/planet_exploration)
- [Project 2 Title](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
- [Project 3 Title](http://example.com/)
